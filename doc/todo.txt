an object (a single set of geometry). Provide some 3D support through the
instance renderer. Refactor the sprite API to use instanced rendering of a quad
object internally.

Set rendering resolution at runtime
Render-screen-to-texture option with scaled output filter options
Runtime switching between windowed and fullscreen
Keyboard and game controller input
Present sync options (vsync, etc.)
Runtime/Lua setting of window title
TTF font support (SDL_ttf, font.h => ttf.h, bmf.h)
