Implement instance renderer; gives a full interface to do instanced rendering of
an object (a single set of geometry). Provide some 3D support through the
instance renderer. Refactor the sprite API to use instanced rendering of a quad
object internally.

Support loading external Lua code for the game code, even not using any compiled-in game code
Set game rendering resolution at runtime
Scalable window, game content centered
Render-to-texture game output option with scaled output filter options
Engine always clears the whole screen to black, render_clear only clears the game content viewport
PRNG
Runtime switching between windowed and fullscreen
Keyboard and game controller input
Present sync options (vsync, etc.)
Runtime/Lua setting of window title
Maybe OpenType font support (SDL_ttf, font.h => ttf.h and bmf.h)? Or only support bitmap fonts?
Fully support saving and loading files, as it uses binser for serialization of save data
Drawing of single-color flat rectangles
Input configuration even with the action set system
